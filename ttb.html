 The Trash Buddies</h3></a>

<h4>Maple Woods</h4>

<p>In the town of Far Valley, there lies a little neighborhood called Sycamore Village. It was a small neighborhood, just a few blocks long. The village was on the edge of a river, which if you followed would lead you to small forest just beyond the highway, Maple Woods. In that forest lived a group of friends who called themselves the Trash Buddies. They called themselves that because eating from trash bins was one of their favorite things to do, and they especially loved to eat trash together in the nearby neighborhood.</p>

<p>Sycamore village was filled with houses, and each one had a garbage can full of the nicest snacks. The Trash Buddies would go there a few times a week to eat and collect food to bring home. Some days, the trash runs would go smoothly. They'd eat the finest French fries and hamburger bits and walk back to their homes with potato chips and berries in tow. Most times they'd even have extras to share with their more reclusive friends. </p>

<p>Though the trips normally went well, going to the village was always a risk. Gizmo, the tough little raccoon who was kind of like the leader of the Trash Buddies, was always telling stories he heard about forest creatures getting hit by cars or taken away in trucks when they ventured into the neighborhood.  He swears that he saw it happen a million times himself. He also swears that it doesn't scare him a bit, but that was a little bit of a lie. Since Gizmo was the leader, he always tried to be fearless. And he normally was. But it's hard to always be fearless, which is why he's thankful to have the Trash Buddies.</p>
<p>Rascal the possum wasn't too worried when he heard the horror stories. He normally played dead when he got nervous, and people around him tended to ignore him when he just lies motionless on the road or dirt. The only thing Rascal got nervous about was about the possibility of his knapsack ripping and dropping all his berries.</p>
<p>Spud, on the other hand, always got really nervous when Rascal would tell those stories. Spud was a skunk, and though he had the ability to make everything around him stinky when he got scared, he didn't really know how to control that ability. Sometimes he would be talking to his other skunk buddy, Dumpling, when his crush Mochi would walk up. She always had little flowers on her head and Spud would get so flustered, he would spray stink all over his pal Dumpling. His friends teased him for it a bit. They especially teased him because when people would get too close and Spud tried to spray them to get away, he just couldn't do it and would have to run away instead. </p>

<p>The Trash Buddies all had some strengths and some flaws, and that's why they are such a great team. Gizmo's leadership, Rascal's fearlessness, and Spud's brain and heart complemented each other well. When they met each other as kids, they instantly knew they'd be friends for life. They started adventuring together when they were little, and it never stopped.</p>

<h4>Preparing for the Thursday Scavenge</h4>

<p>After a couple years of scavenging together, the trash buddies realized Thursday nights are when the trash bins are the fullest. So they always made sure to go to the village on Thursdays to stock up. </p>

<p>It was a Thursday morning in autumn, and Rascal was up early. Most days he and his friends would stay up late and sleep during the day, but Thursdays they needed to prepare before their big trips, so they didn't sleep much. So he and his girlfriend, Peaches, got up early and ate some berries together in their big tree stump. </p>
<p>"It looks like our food is pretty low, Rascy. Are you guys planning on taking Squish or Dumpling tonight to help bring more food back to the woods?" Peaches asked.</p>

<p>"I think so. I'm gonna go meet up with Giz and Squish soon and see what the plan is."</p>

<p>Squish was Gizmo's older brother. He came along on the trips sometimes. He enjoys food a lot more than some of the other forest animals, so he liked being able to stuff himself full on Thursdays. Him and Gizmo lived in a tree nearby. They never woke up early like Rascal, though. Not even on Thursdays. So Rascal decided to go meet up with Spud. They liked to check in with all their friends nearby to see how their food supply was so they could bring enough back to their woods. </p>

<p>"I'm gonna go get Spud and do our rounds," Rascal declared. "See you later, peachy." Rascal said as he kissed Peaches on the nose. Then he left the den to go see Spud and his best friend, Dumpling. When he got outside, he admired the beautiful Maple he lived in with his sweetheart. The leaves were so bright and orange this time of year. Some leaves had fallen over night. He took note of that, thinking to himself that he'd make a pile to jump in later. Then he took off. </p>

<p>Spud and Dumpling lived a little farther away. At the edge of Maple Woods was a small river. If you took a bridge just behind Rascal's tree, you'd end up in Clover Meadow. That's where Spud and Dumpling lived, in a big rock crevice right beyond the bridge. Neither the woods nor meadow were too big, so the trash buddies were friends with most creatures who lived between the two places. Though most creatures here were omnivores, there had been a pact in the meadow and woods for generations that no creature would eat another creature that lived there, and they would venture to another wood or meadow if they needed to eat an animal. This made the area a lot happier. Besides the bugs and fish, which weren't included in the pact. </p>

<p>When Rascal arrived, he could hear Spud and Dumpling arguing. </p>

<p>"I didn't eat the rest of the leftovers!" Dumpling exclaimed. "You must have finished them and forgot."</p>

<p>"I know I didn't," said Spud. "I was saving those for before our trip later! Now what will I eat?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you can find some grasshoppers and berries in the meadow."</p>

<p>"It's getting too cold for grasshoppers! Besides, I wanted the leftovers," said Spud dolefully. I spent hours collecting and cooking for that." </p>

<p>It seemed to be getting heated in there. Rascal knew what they were talking about. When it started getting colder and days got shorter, Spud always cooked up a big pot of what he called his 'Delectable Trash Porridge.' It was made with foods they collected from the bins, as well as vegetation and bugs found in the meadow. He was very particular with his leftovers this time of year, since the bugs and vegetation were less abundant and his porridge couldn't be made quite the same with just food from the bins. </p>

<p>Rascal made his presence known, and both Spud and Dumpling came out to greet him.</p>

<p>"Hey, Rascal!" shouted Dumpling. "Haven't seen you in a bit!"</p>

<p>"Hey man! Yeah, I've been in the den with a Peaches a lot the last few days. Glad to see you though! You coming with later?"</p>

<p>"No, not this time. Have fun though!" Dumpling said before making his way back inside. He didn't normally come on their adventures. Dumpling was a spotted skunk, so he was a lot smaller than his friend Spud.  Being a spotted skunk also meant he was even more timid than Spud, somehow, and he rarely liked to leave the forest or be near humans. He felt bad about this, but his friends didn't mind.</p>

<p>After Dumpling went in, Spud and Rascal started talking. </p>

<p>"I heard your porridge is all out already. Want me to help you dig up some beetles while we do our rounds?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Spud said thankfully. "That'd be great."</p>

<p>So Spud and Rascal went off as they do every Thursday morning, checking on friends and neighbors in the meadow before heading to the woods. </p>

<p>Nearby Spud's den was one of their pals, Cypress. Cypress was a little brown mouse with the biggest ears. He lived in a burrow with a bunch of other mice, but he was really proud of the fact that he dug most of the burrow himself. Since he lived underground, Spud did his famous foot stomp to get Cypress's attention. When Cypress came out,  he ran really fast and jumped up to hug Rascal! He always admired Rascal.</p>  

<p>"Hi friends!" he tried to shout with his tiny excited voice. "So happy to see you! You guys doing a supply check?</p>

<p>In unison, Spud and Rascal both told him yes. </p>

<p>"How are you guys doing?" asked Rascal. "In need of anything specific? More corn or oats from the bins? Or need any help scavenging for seeds this week?" Besides the trips to the bins they do one to three times a week, they also help friends collect seeds, berries, bugs, and anything else they can scrounge up around them. The Trash  Buddies love being helpful. </p>

<p>"Well," thought Cypress, "we are actually pretty low on everything. I don't know how the supply dwindled so fast."</p>

<p>"We're having the same issue over in the forest. My leftover porridge is gone faster than normal, and everything else in the pantry." Spud said sadly. </p>

<p>"Alright. So we'll make sure to get some food in the bins for your colony, and we can do some foraging Saturday. You're welcome to come with any of your friends if you want to help." Rascal relayed his plan to Cypress. Though gizmo was the leader, Rascal enjoyed the organization and planning that helping everyone out involved. </p>

<p>"Sounds great, Rascal! I'll see you tomorrow when you come by with the supplies!" Cypress told them goodbye and headed back to his burrow. Before he went in, he made sure to request they grab him some cheese.</p>

<p>Rascal and Spud went walking further in the meadow. There were a bunch of wildflowers out, probably not for much longer with the cold approaching. In the flower field they saw two of their deer pals, Fawn and Primrose. They lived among some bushes and fir trees in the meadow. Fawn and Primrose had been in love since they were both little fawns. They were really great together. Primrose was really sweet. She was always carefree and frolicking in the flowers with Butterflies, while Fawn looked out for Prim and made sure she was taken care of. They were cute together and complemented each other well. Some of the older creatures didn't understand why two female deer would be in love, but most understood just fine that anyone could love anyone. </p>

<p>"Hey boys!" shouted Primrose gleefully from far away. "Come see these Butterflies! They're so tickly when they land on you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they've felt Butterflies before, Rose" said Fawn jokingly. Though most friends called Primrose Prim, Rose was meant for only Fawn to call her. </p>

<p>"Coming!" Said Spud as he and Rascal hurried over.</p>

<p>After a conversation about butterflies, Fawn let's them know that they're getting worried about food. </p>

<p>"The grass will be covered soon. We still have berries and can eat from the Ash and Maple trees, but if you could help us stock up on fruits and cabbage that'd be really helpful." Fawn didn't like to show when she was worried. Since she prided herself in caring for Primrose, she always felt bad when she couldn't collect enough fruit for them and the rest of their herd. </p>

<p>"No worries, Fawn! We'll get you some fruit. And I already let Cypress know, we will be doing some foraging in the meadow Saturday if you want to join." Rascal felt confident that he could find some good fruit for the deer. He was a little worried he wouldn't be able to carry enough in his knapsack, though. After saying goodbye, Rascal picked a few flowers for Peaches and then they went to talk to their friend Rowan who had a wagon they could borrow.</p>

<p>Rowan was a sly red fox that had a den near Spud. Rowan used to go to the village with the Trash Buddies, but he was getting older and liked to stay near home most days now. But Rowan still let them use his little red wagon. On days they needed to bring back more than a few handfuls of food, they would borrow the wagon and Gizmo would pull it. Sometimes Rascal would pull Spud around in it for fun when Gizmo wasn't watching. Since Rowan was mostly carnivorous, the Trash Buddies couldn't help him out a ton with food. They always tried to bring him back some hamburger and fruit, though. Or pizza rolls if they could find any, those were his guilty pleasure. </p>

<p>After chatting with Rowan for a bit and getting the wagon, they checked on with their bunny friend Clove who requested fruit, veggies, and herbs. </p>

<p>Rascal and Spud left the weeping willow that Clove's den was nearby and headed south a bit to where the river met a little pond. Above the pond was the most serene waterfall slowly trickling down. The river continued past some boulders above them, but they had never been above or beyond the waterfall. While they were there, they dug up a few beetles for Spud to eat. They also caught a few dragonflies that were swarming around, and Rascal caught a crayfish in the river. After their snack they headed back into the woods to wake up Gizmo. </p>

<h4>The Plan</h4>

<p>It was Thursday afternoon and Gizmo was waking up. He wanted a little more sleep but his brother Squish was rummaging around the den making all sorts of noise. </p>

<p>"Ughh," Gizmo exclaimed.</p> 

<p>"Sorry, bro. I got hungry."</p>
<p>"It's fine, I guess. I'm sure Rascal and Spud will be here soon, anyway."</p>
<p>Just moments later, his friends showed up ready to talk about the plan for the night.</p> 

<pì"So everyone is pretty low on food. We need to scrounge up lots and lots of fruit, some veggies, herbs, and a little meat. And of course the most delectable trash we can find for ourselves. I really enjoyed the French fries the other day, hopefully there's more of those." Rascal confidently expressed his plan to Gizmo.</p>

<p>"Sounds great, Rascal! Yeah, the fries were good. I'm hoping for some cookies. Have you guys talked to our neighbors out here yet or just in the meadow?"</p>

<p>Rascal let him know they'd only been to the meadow so far. So they took off to chat with a couple more friends. Ponchy and Sinnamon were two squirrels who lived nearby, but they were always off adventuring so sometimes it was hard to locate them. After a half hour they finally came across them running up in a tree.</p>

<p>"Hey guys!" Said Spud. "Come down for a minute!"</p>

<p>Ponchy and Sinnamon ran and jumped and ended up by their feet. </p>

<p>"What's up? asked Ponchy. "You guys going to the village later?"</p>

<p>"Yep! How are you guys doing?"</p>

<p>"We're okay," Ponchy let them know. "We've been storing lots of nuts for the winter. But if you can find a melon or a radish, we've been craving both of those pretty bad!"</p>

<p>"Sounds good, Ponchy." Rascal then asked if he knew if anyone else was in need of anything. </p>

<p>"Yeah, I think Lucida could use a hotdog. She's always talking about those." </p>

<p>"Thanks, Ponchy! We'll get her some if we can find any." </p>

<p>They all said their goodbyes and the trash buddies headed back to Gizmo's place. They didn't have time to visit their fox friend, Lucida, today. But they'd give her some food tomorrow and spend some time catching up soon. </p>

<p>When they arrived back at Gizmo's, they finalized their plan for the food heist. They knew what food they were gonna look for. They had knapsacks and a wagon. Squish said he'd help so they had an extra pair of hands. They just had to decide how to divide and conquer. Since Squish was getting on Gizmo's nerves lately, they decided that Gizmo and Spud go together, while Squish and Rascal go a different way. The neighborhood wasn't too large, about 74 houses spread around a couple blocks. They knew which houses had the best food in their bins, so Gizmo and Spud took the West half and Rascal and Squish took the East. Rascal was excited because the east had one of his favorite houses. At the end of a road was a little yellow house with a dog named Rebel, and he liked to help them, or sometimes just play with them. Gizmo had a tougher side. People were a little more active at night around those houses, so he would have to be more careful. </p>

<p>Now the trash buddies had their plan for the night. They loved being organized for their Thursday night trips. When they go to the neighborhood other days, they normally just get food for themselves so it doesn't involve such serious planning. Also autumn tends to be the most stressful season as they animals prepare for winter. A lot of the animals hate the cold. Some even sleep through most of it. So they stock up on food  and cook a lot of meals in Autumn. </p>

<p>It's starting to get dark out now, but it's still too early for them to go out. The Trash Buddies grab Squish and Dumpling and head back to Rascal's. They all started making a big pile of Maple leaves while Rascal heads back inside.</p>

<p>Rascal went in and gave Peaches a big surprise kiss and the flowers he collected in the meadow.</p>

<p>"Aw, thanks sweetie. Thy are so beautiful. I'll have to go find a vase." </p>
<p>Rascal helps Peaches find a vase and then they go out to see the huge leaf pile. They spend the evening jumping in the leaves and laughing together. Sinnamon and Ponchy join in, too and get Dumpling to play tag with them.</p>

<p>When it's almost time to leave, they all head home to grab their hats and knapsacks, then they meet at the bridge when they're ready.</p> 
<h4>The Snack Heist</h4>

<p>Gizmo, Rascal, Spud, and Squish had all arrived at the bridge. It was the middle of the night. The moon and stars shun brightly. It was cold enough they all had hats and jackets on, besides Squish who normally stayed warm.</p>

<p>They all started walking north towards the village. They had some idle  chit-chat, but they mostly liked to stay focused beforehand. After a little walk, they ended up at the edge of the forest. It was covered in pine and fir trees, making the forest and Prairie invisible to people. Once they crossed that line, it was go-time. They'd have to cross the big highway, which was busy during the day but mostly quiet at night. Then they'd separate and get the food. </p>

<p>They all looked both ways and ran.</p>

<p>Squish and Rascal headed east towards a cul-de-sac. When they got to the road, they saw so many bins just waiting for them at the end of each person's driveway. It was like the people were offering their food to them. Squish started going for the first bin he saw and Rascal had to remind him to keep quiet while he was munching on pretzels, and he told him which houses they should check out first.</p>

<p>Rascal started making his way down the road with Squish not too far behind. He found a big bin by a brown house and hopped inside. This one normally didn't have the best stuff but he wanted to check. All he could see were banana peels, plastic bags, and onion skins. He ate a random blueberry and jumped out. The next house normally had good stuff. He hopped in to find fries, half-eaten pizza rolls, and some broken hamburgers. He hit the jackpot! He had two knapsacks and He filled most of one of them with the delectable. He checked a few more houses and grabbed some fruits and veggies. Squish ate a bunch of clementines and packed some corn in one of his bags. Then together they went to the yellow house at the end of the street.</p>

<p>Rascal was excited. He hadn't been to that house in a few weeks, and he hoped Rebel would be awake. Instead of stopping at the bin, they walked around some shrubbery to the backyard. There was a wooden porch and a glass door, which had a little hole for Rebel to come out. Rascal had tried going inside before, but the little door only opens for Rebel. They waited outside making little noises that the humans shouldn't hear but the dog should. A few minutes later, they saw a little head popping out the door. Soon, Rebel the little hound was outside with them. He was white with brown and black spots all over, and he had the biggest juiciest ears. </p>

<p>"Raaaascal!" barked Rebel excitedly. "I missed you! Want to play?"</p> 

<p>"I probably can't today. We have a lot of food to collect."</p>

<p>"Ooh, I can help you. Mom left a bunch of snacks on the counter. She told mama that they're for the fair tomorrow, but I'm sure she won't mind!"</p>

<p>So Rebel went inside, jumped until his little paws reached the counter, and brought down a few containers of food. </p>

<p>"Woah!" exclaimed Rascal. "Cookies, cupcakes, and sandwiches. That could last us forever! Not sure how we could carry it, though. Do you think we could stash them under the porch and come back later with the wagon?"</p>

<p>Rebel agreed and said that he would keep a lookout until they came. With that, they said goodbyes and Rascal and Squish headed west. They went to a few more houses, collecting veggies and grains on the way, and continued on until they reached Gizmo and Spud.</p>

<p>Gizmo and Spud's night hadn't been going quite as well. They normally tried to go to houses where all the lights were off, but so many were on over here. They found little success at their first few houses. Some green beans, cabbage, and pumpkin seeds. Gizmo smelled something delicious towards the end of the block, so he and Spud headed towards the smell.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it could be! Maybe turkey legs?" Spud contemplated.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure but it smells delicious! Let's go, and be sneaky!"</p>

<p>Gizmo and Spud made it to the house. When they opened the bin, it was more magical then they could have guessed. It was almost an entire chicken! It smelled delicious but was a little dark, maybe why the people put it out here. Spud knew this would be delicious in his delectable trash porridge! Especially with the green beans they found. Gizmo was in the can, slowly handing Spud pieces to throw in the wagon, when they heard shouting. </p>

<p>"Get! Get out of there! Goooo!" They heard a woman yelling, so they looked towards the house. She was coming right towards them, just how some of the horror stories started. </p>

<p>"Giz, get out! She's coming this way!"</p>

<p>"Pull me out!" Spud helped Gizmo out of the bin as the woman kept approaching, a wooden bat in her arms. "Grab the wagon, Gizmo. We have to run!"</p>

<p>"I can't run, this is heavy! I need you to spray her so I have time to get away. Otherwise, we'll have to abandon the food and the wagon!"</p>

<p>Spud was afraid. Really afraid. He started stomping his feet to scare the lady away. He didn't want to do this, but he knew it was all riding on him. The lady shrieked but kept coming towards him. She was getting close. Spud turned to see that Gizmo had made it a house away and was starting to hid behind a bush. It was his only chance.</p>

<p>Spud maneuvered his body so his butt faced the woman and so did his face. He channeled his fear, and with all his might he closed his eyes and tried to spray the woman. Spud heard her scream. </p>

<p>When he opened them, he realized it hadn't worked. It failed again. But he scared the lady enough that she ran back to the porch calling to someone named Robert. Spud took his chance and ran as fast as he could down the street. </p>

<p>As he was running, he kept looking behind him. And he tripped. When he turned, he saw Rascal standing in front of him with the biggest smile.</p>

<p>"You okay, Spud? We have great news. We found tons of food, we just have to get the wagon and go back to get it." Rascal paused. "Where's Gizmo?"</p>

<p>Spud took a few deep breaths and led his friends towards the closest bush where he told them what had happened. </p>

<p>"It's okay the spray didn't work, Spud. At least you're alright." Spud felt dejected, but he was thankful his friends understood. Right then, Gizmo came up with the wagon. </p>

<p>After they all settled down, the trash buddies realized the sun would be rising soon. Together, they all scurried off back to Rebel's house to collect the trays of food. They didn’t see Rebel at the back door, so one at a time they crawled under the porch. When they were all down there, they looked around. There was no food in sight. </p>

<h4>The Troublemakers</h4>
<p>They didn't understand. Rascal was sure that Rebel wouldn't take the food away. He didn't understand why it could be gone. They were all sad, as they had really been counting on those trays of food to help them through fall. Rascal peeked into the house to see if Rebel was nearby, but he couldn't see anything. After one last thorough check under the porch, they started to head home. The trip was still quite successful. All sorts of fruits, veggies, grains, meat, and a little sweets. They really didn't have anything to be disappointed about, so they tried to be happy and headed towards the forest. </p>

<p>Since the sun would come out soon, they tried to go fast. The journey wasn't too long.  After a short trot, they finally ended up at the highway. All they had to do was cross, and they would be back at their forest. They were all ecstatic to show friends what food they'd brought back for them. </p>

<p>They looked left, and it was all clear. They looked right. There were no cars, but what they saw was even scarier. Down the street were their enemies, the Troublemakers. They were a group of animals that lived a little farther away in the heart of Far Valley, the city. The leader of their group was Fang. He was a raggedy raccoon, about Squish's age. They used to know each other, long ago. But Fang had always been mean. He used to throw Squish's lunch on the ground back in their school days. Now he was more of a criminal, stealing other animals' food instead of doing the work himself. A couple times he came to the forest to try to steal food from the Trash Buddies, but luckily Rowan scared him off before he could find them.</p> 

<p>Next to Fang was a small raccoon named Tycoon. Tycoon grew up in the prairie, right next door to Spud. They'd actually been best friends until a few years ago. Nobody knew what happened. One day Tycoon was best friends with Spud, and the next he was off with Fang wreaking havoc around town. Sometimes Spud would still get sad when he saw the Troublemakers, grieving his old friendship. </p>

<p>Lastly, down low behind Tycoon was the dirtiest, meanest rat they'd ever seen. His name was Corky. They didn't know much about him. They think he grew up in the city with a bunch of brothers. He'd only been in the Troublemakers for a little bit, though. Fang must have seen him one day and recruited him because he was so mean and dirty.</p>

<p>The Trash Buddies froze. They wondered if they had time to get away. They figured maybe if they dropped the food they could run, but they really needed that food. And one of them would probably chase them, anyway. They didn't have time to talk. They just looked at each other and hoped they were all on the same page. As the Troublemakers approached them with this sly fast walk, Rascal and Squish grabbed their knapsacks. They took out the biggest things they could find, apples and oranges. And once the bullies were close enough, they started pelting them with fruit. Squish hit Corky right away, which really slowed him down. But the other two were bigger and tougher. </p>

<p>Gizmo grabbed some pf the food from the wagon and stuffed it in his pockets. He hoped that'd make the wagon lighter. He asked Spud to pull the wagon out of sight while he made a distraction. Gizmo grabbed his brother by the arm and they started stomping towards the bullies, hoping that appearing tough and causing a scene would get them to leave.</p> 

<p>"Get out of here, Fang. You're not welcome in this neighborhood." Squish tried to sound intimidating. Fang was his biggest nemesis, and he got so much anger whenever he saw him. </p>

<p>Fang cackled. "Why should I listen to you? You think your little brother is gonna save you? You better watch how you talk to me or  there will be hell to pay." Fang nodded at both his accomplices and they scurried towards Rascal, about knocking him over stealing food from his bags. </p>

<p>"Hey! Get away from me!" Rascal felt afraid. He knew these guys could hurt him bad. He's seen Fang carrying around knives before and heard stories of him using them on other animals. He hated to do it, but Rascal knew the safest thing was to retreat. He dropped his bags and hurried away to try and meet Spud, making sure to zig-zag so they couldn't find him too easily. </p>

<p>"Haha! Your friends are cowards. How about you, Gizmo? Are you afraid?" Fang grabbed an apple from Gizmo's pocket, and from his pocket he grabbed a knife. With the quickest swish, he cut a piece of apple and shoved it in his mouth. Gizmo and Squish knew this was his way of saying to run or get slashed, so they started to back away slowly. They saw Corky and Tycoon picking up all the food they'd thrown and dropped behind them, so they weren't sure where to go. </p>

<p>When they had about lost hope, Rebel came sprinting up to them. With the loudest howls, he scared the Troublemakers off. They must have been very afraid of dogs because not seconds later they were out of sight. Gizmo and Squish started to feel safe and rejoice, but they realized that with the Troublemakers went half the food they'd grabbed. Everything Rascal and Squish had grabbed was gone. All that was left was what was With Spud.</p>

<p>"Rebel! How lucky we are to see you! Hurry, let's go get the others before they come back and take what we have left."</p>

<p>They got to the bush where Spud and Rascal were hiding. </p>

<p>"Rebel, what are you doing here?" Rascal asked with a bit of an attitude. He was still confused about why the food was gone when they went back for it.</p>

<p>"Rebel scared them off, Rascal! He's a lifesaver." Gizmo said affirmatively. But after thinking, he asked "how did you know we needed help?"</p>

<p>"Well," started Rebel, "I'd been on lookout for a while watching the food. I went inside for a minute for some water, and when I looked out the front door, I saw the Troublemakers walking around. I decided to get the food I gave you guys and bring it back inside to keep it safe, I know they're always stealing."</p>

<p>Rascal nodded as Rebel talked. He was starting to understand. </p>

<p>"After that, I tried to keep lookout from the front door. I think I fell asleep for a few minutes, though. I'm sorry if you came back for the food and didn't understand." Rebel let out sad beagle whines. He felt really bad.  "When I woke up, I saw you guys were leaving the neighborhood, but I saw the Troublemakers slowly approaching you from the west. So I decided to come help you guys. I figured it was the least I could do for falling asleep on lookout duty."</p>

<p>After a small pause, Rascal let Rebel know that it's okay he fell asleep and they weren't upset with him. They were just thankful for his help. Thankful to have such a great friend. </p>

<p>Rebel became bashful, and then he let them know that they were still welcome to the food if they wanted it. After exchanging quick glances amongst themselves, they all nodded. Together, they started heading back into the neighborhood. </p>

<h4>A Daunting Task</h4>

<p>The sun would be out in no time at all, so they really had to hurry. They decided they needed to get a little more food before heading back to Rebel's for the food trays. They all split up, but made sure they could always see one another from where they were. They checked bins they had skipped the first time and bins they knew they had left some food in. Gizmo went back for the rest of the chicken he wasn't able to grab because the woman came out. Spud found berries and bread. Squish found chicken nuggets and cabbage. Rascal grabbed handfuls of tacos, as well as extra fruit since they lost most of theirs. After running quickly from bin to bin to bin, they sprinted to Rebels. They started to see the sun. People would be coming out any second, and the highway would be filled with cars commuting to work in the city. They had to hurry. </p>

<p>At Rebel's, he was waiting for them. He had stashed the trays under a bush since he knew his moms would be waking up soon to take him for a walk. With the trays of food, he also left two things most precious to him. A doggy treat and a squeaky green bouncy ball. Rascal smirked. He was thankful, and be knew he'd come back another day to play ball with Rebel. But for now, they needed to bolt. They put what they could in their pockets and what knapsacks they had left, and the rest went in the wagon. It was pretty full, so Squish pushed while Gizmo pulled. When they arrived at the highway, only a few cars were passing. Quickly, they made it over and dashed into the woods as if they were never there at all.</p>

<p>It was almost morning, so they needed some rest. They all took what they'd been carrying and went home. They'd separate and distribute food tomorrow. For now, they needed to sleep. Gizmo and Squish went to their tree together and stashed the wagon outside. Spud went home to tell his buddy Dumpling about their night. Rascal gets home to Peaches and she is waiting there, crocheting a blanket, fresh baked grasshopper cookies waiting on the table. He felt loved and he felt safe. After two cookies, he grabbed his lady and they headed to bed together. To the sound of birds waking up and chirping outside, everyone drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p>It was time to wake up before they knew it. The Trash Buddies all met up at Gizmo's and talked about distribution. They always tried to make it fair. Since they collected food multiple days, Thursdays were mostly for sharing, and other days were days to collect food for themselves. So they chose the little bits they'd keep for themselves, and they split the rest as fairly as possible. They made sure to grab tons of fruit and greens to bring to the prairie for Cypress, Clove, Fawn, and Primrose. They got pizza rolls and apples for Rowan. Ponchy and Sinnamon got some radishes, and Lucida got some hot dog pieces. </p>

<p>They spent the afternoon delivering food, making good conversation with friends, and talking about weekend plans. It was Friday now, and they decided they'd do a bunch of gathering around the meadow and woods Saturday for grains, bugs, berries, and anything else they could find. Then Sunday, they planned to have a big picnic and play games at the broken log down by Juniper the hedgehog and Mochi. That's where they gathered for big events. The Trash Buddies made sure to let everyone know they were invited both days. </p>

<p>After a long day of distribution and conversation, they all went back to their homes for the rest of the day and night. The night before had been pretty tiring and stressful, so they needed to wind down.</p>

<p>Back at Spud's, he and Dumpling talked about what they wanted to do at the Picnic Sunday. Spud said he wanted to play tag, and Dumpling wanted to play hide and seek. They decided they'd try to get a big group to play a combined version, where you hide but as soon as someone is close to finding you then you have to run away and find a new hiding spot. They were really excited for a day of fun. September was a little chilly, but it wouldn't be this nice out again for months so they wanted to take advantage of the weather.</p>

<p>Peaches and Rascal spent the night relaxing together. Peaches did more crocheting, she was making hats and scarves for Rascal and  Mochi. Rascal decided to read a little. He loved books, and so did a lot of the other creatures. That's how they learned so much about the humans. Sometimes humans would leave books outside at their homes or in the city, and the Trash Buddies would bring them home and share with all the creatures. The only one that couldn't really read the books was Cypress, because he was too small the hold them. Rascal often read him stories. Tonight, Rascal was reading a book about fairies that lived in a forest. He loved reading these fantastical things, and sometimes he wished they were true. </p>

<p>Gizmo and Squish played with Ponchy and Sinnamon for a while, then they watched TV together in their tree. It was a nice calm night in Far Valley. Soon, it was a new day.</p>

<h4>Title</h4>

<p>Saturday afternoon, many of the creatures in the prarie and woods gather at the bridge. It's time to gather. They'll gather food, supplies, and anything useful they can find together. Whenever the do big gathering events like this, they like to do it all together instead of splitting into groups. It makes them all feel closer and is much more fun. Rowan brings his empty wagon that the Buddies returned the day before, and many of the creatures have bags and pockets to carry what they find. They set off on their adventure together. </p>

<p>They started in the prairie. They decided to head to the waterfall first. There were tons of bugs to collect over there, and a few of the creatures try collecting fish and crayfish. Spud collects a fish for his porridge he is planning to make later. Gizmo and Squish gather a few bugs and nuts and then stand by the waterfall, admiring it. Gizmo is the most curious of the bunch about what is above the waterfall. He assumes the river must go forever up there, and that there's probably more woods and prairie up there. He's not too afraid of climbing up there, but he hasn't found an easy way to do it. Maybe one day he would be able to.</p> 

<p>Spud, Clove, and Cypress went over by the weeping willow to gather. They found seeds, nuts, sticks, and bugs. These three animals got along really well. They were all kind-hearted and thought of others before themselves. That's why they often hung out as a trio. </p>

<p>"Spud, there's a fallen branch over here. There might be some beetles underneath" Clove told Spud. She lived right near here and saw the branch fall the day before, but she couldn't move it herself. Together, he and Spud moved the branch and saw a bunch of beetles and isopods. Spud took some isopods and left the beetles for the others.</p> 

<p>The prairie was so beautiful that day. The clouds were making the sun shine in rays all over the field, illuminating patches of grass. Sinnamon, Ponchy, and Clove jumped from light patch to light patch as they moved around with the clouds. The warm grass was nice and comforting on this chilly day. </p>

<p>When Clove went off to play with the squirrels, Spud looked around at all his friends. Amongst them he saw the prettiest girl, Mochi. He hadn't spoken to her much the last few days. Or really, he hadn't spoken to her much at all. He always froze when they tried to talk. She was just too pretty with the pink and purple flowers on her head. He had liked her since they were little kits. He felt like he could be brave today, after how wild Thursday was. So he walked up to talk to her.</p>

<p>"Hey Mochi! How are you?" he asked her quietly. </p>

<p>"Aw hi, Spuds! I'm doing great. It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?" Her smile beamed as bright as the sunshine. </p>

<p>"Yeah, it really is beautiful," said Spud, staring right into Mochi's eyes. "So are you gonna be at the picnic tomorrow?" Spud stuttered out. </p>

<p>"Yeah, of course! You know I live right there, how could I miss it?" She smiled at Spud. "Feel free to drop by beforehand if you need help with anything. I assume you're bringing some food to share?"</p>

<p>"You know it." Spud winked at her. Mochi had always loved his Delectable Trash Porridge. That's part of why he made it so often. </p>

<p>Spud went off to find Gizmo, who was still staring at the waterfall. "Enjoying it over here?"</p>

<p>Gizmo was startled. He had such intense focus on the water flowing and crashing down that he didn't notice what had been happening around him. He completely forgot he was supposed to be gathering. </p>

<p>"Oh shoot. Guess I was staring off again. I'm just so curious, you know? What could be out there? There could be more friends, more food. Somewhere nicer to live." Gizmo went on and on. Spud liked hearing about Gizmo's interest. He loved when friends talked about their passions, like when Rascal gushed about fantasy books or Peaches delightfully showed off her craft projects. And the waterfall was Gizmo's thing. Spud always hoped he'd be able to help Gizmo get up there one day.</p>

<p>"One day, we'll see. I promise." Spud and Gizmo smiled and went off to gather near the flower fields, checking in with Primrose and Fawn along the way. </p>

<p>Rascal and Peaches were holding hands. They'd gathered lots of berries from the bushes and nuts that had fallen from the trees. They'd share most of it and save some for a pie they planned to bake together for the picnic. Mixed berry and oat pie. It was delicious, and baking was one of the couple's favorite activities to do together. Making messes while mixing ingredients, taste testing together. It was romantic, and they loved all things romantic. Peaches and Rascal had been in love since they were joeys basically. Their mom's had been best friends and had babies just days apart. Back in school, they'd pass love notes and laugh after class. They knew they were destined to be, and have been inseparable since. Together, they gathered some more before inviting everyone to finish gathering in the woods. </p>

<p>The woods were much different for gathering. Different trees meant different sticks and nuts, different berries for different bushes. The bugs were different, too. Rowan and Lucida decided to stay by the river and fish for the group, and everyone went off to finish gathering. When the sun started to set, they got together to share and trade. They were all excited about their Sunday picnic. It would be there first one in a while. They did lots of activities as groups in the woods, but they only did picnics about once a month, and that was about the only time everyone would be together. </p>

<p>All the creatures went home for the night. Some needed to bake or cook. Others got decorations for the picnic together or small gifts to give their friends the next day. Some prepared games to bring. But they all went home and did something to prepare. Friendship was important to all the creatures in the prairie and woods, so they made sure to do all they could do foster those friendships year round.</p>

<h4>Delectable Trash Porridge</h4>

<p>It was Sunday morning at last. The birds were singing, and all the creatures got up early to prepare for their day of fun. </p>

<p>Spud woke up excited about the day. Yesterday he had collected fish and isopods when gathering, and they would make the most delicious addition to his porridge. He always made the porridge a little different. It always included some grains and fruits, but the rest always changed. Today he was making a huge batch so that he would have some to share and some to keep all for himself, and maybe Mochi. He went to his pantry to see what he could use. Among food, his pantry also held pretty flowers and pinecones and other cool things from thr woods. It made the home feel cozier. First Spud found some oats and boiled them in the biggest pot he could find. He simmered a bunch of berries and cooked his fish, then he added that to the pot. After the porridge simmered for most of the day, he would add isopods and other little flavorings he found. </p>

<p>Spud was excited for the day, but he was nervous about Mochi. She invited him to come by early, so Spud planned to go over and offer her first taste at his porridge. He wasn't sure what would happen beyond that, though. Spud decided to let the porridge simmer and take a long bath to keep him calm. Dumpling left to go hang out with Squish, but not without a spoonful of porridge first. </p>

<p>Over in the maple tree stump, Peaches and Rascal were making their oat and berry pie. They made a nice oaty crust and let that bake while they had coffee and tea together. Rascal loved coffee, and Peaches loved tea. Sometimes, they'd switch drinks. Rascal didn't enjoy tea, and Peaches didn't enjoy coffee; it always felt nice to try what the other love, though. </p>

<p>They loved baking together, so they made the pie fancy. On top of the oat crust would be multiple layers. The bottom was a blueberry gelatin, made from blueberries. Next would be the main mixed berry filling. Made with blueberries and wild strawberries, it would make the most delicious balance between sweet and tart. Lastly, on top was an elderberry syrup drizzled on top. There was only one elderberry bush around here, and it was by the lake. It made the most delicious syrup to eat on pastries or in a Peaches' tea. They had to be careful with how much they used since it was only one bush. Sometimes Rascal wondered if there were more elderberry bushes beyond the waterfall. </p>

<p>While the pie baked, they picked a puzzle to do together. It was a puzzle with pretty herbs and flowers on it. Rebel had given it to the Trash Buddies a few months back.</p>

<p>Gizmo and Squish spent the morning getting some games ready for the picnic. Dumpling came by to help them out. They had another hole in the tree where they often stored things they owned that weren't used day to day. They found a couple games to play, a couple balls to bring, and a homemade board game that Squish and Dumpling made together when they were younger. After putting the other games together by the door, they all decided to play the game together before the picnic since they bad time. </p>

<p>Once it was almost sunset, the creatures started getting ready for the big picnic. Spud smelled nice from his bath. He got a big platter and filled it with his porridge. He also grabbed a nice bowl and filled it with porridge for Mochi. Spud made sure to add extra isopods on hers. </p>

<p>Spud walked over the bridge and down past Rascal's. He passed the picnic log and Gizmo's tree before ending up at Mochi's. Her and Juniper lived in a cluster of walnut trees. They lived closest to the pine and fir trees separating the woods and the highway. Some of the smaller creatures didn't like venturing this far towards the trees, but Spud didn't mind at all. They almost never felt in danger in the woods. </p>

<p>Spud arrived and knocked on Mochi's door. They lived inside the tree trunk and had a cute little sign on their door by Peaches. When Mochi came to open thr door, she had the sweetest smile and a yellow flower crown on her head. Behind her was Juniper. Spud didn't know a ton about her, as she hadn't been living in the forest for long. She seemed really kind, though. Spud did know that Juniper often got anxious, so she didn't attend all events. She didn't go scavenging the day before, but Mochi told Spud that she was going to try tonight.</p> 

<p>"Hey Mochi. Hey Juniper! How are ya? I heard you might come join us at the picnic later?"</p>

<p>"Oh hi Spud! Nice to see you. Umm," Juniper stuttered. "I might go, I'm not sure yet."</p>

<p>"Well we'd all love to see you there if you're up for it."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Spud! I'm gonna go read a bit. Have fun, guys!"</p>

<p>Spud tucked his head and arm outside, and then he emerged holding a bowl of porridge for Mochi.</p>

<p>"Here, I brought some porridge for you. Wanted to make sure you got some in case it went fast later." He smiled nervously at Mochi. </p>

<p>"Oh wow, thanks Spud! Can I try it now?" Spud sat with Mochi as she ate most of her porridge. They talked about the game of Hide and Tag that Dumpling and Spud were looking forward to. Then they kept talking about all sorts of stuff. Before they knew it, it was time for the picnic.</p>

<p>"Oh wow, the time flew." </p>

<p>"Time always flies when you're having fun." Mochi said both bashfully and confidently, confusing Spud. "Is it time to go?"</p>

<p>Mochi went to check on Juniper. Spud tagged along and let her know how much everyone would love to see her there. After some thinking, Juniper decided to go to the picnic. Mochi let her know they could come home together anytime if she got too anxious. They all went outside and strolled around the corner to the picnic log.  Most of their friends were already waiting. </p>

<p>"Hey, guys!" Gizmo greeted them excitedly. "Almost everyone is here! Come check out the food!" Gizmo brought them over to the log where there was the most beautiful spread. Some delicious looking pies from Rascal and Peaches, grasshopper cornbread that Clove and Cypress made together, and a platter of lavender bars from Primrose and Fawn. Spud put his porridge in the center of the table. Everyone had brought something to share. They all knew it would be a great day.</p>

<p>Together, they all sat by the log and on stumps and rocks, telling stories while they ate their food. Gizmo recounted the story of what happened Thursday with the Troublemakers. Rascal shared what was going on in his fantasy book. When they all finished eating their food, they played games together. Some played board games, some played hide and tag. Some just enjoyed watching their friends have fun. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon filled with laughter and friendship. What a wonderful way to begin Autumn. </p>

<p>As the sun went away and the stars came out, the creatures started saying goodbye and heading home. Everyone left thankful that night. The Trash Buddies were glad that they could help provide food for their friends to cook and share, and they all went to bed excited to do this all again soon.</p>

<h3 class="chtitle"><a id="ch2">Chapter 2: October<br>
Trash Buddies Trick-and-Treat </h3></a>


<h4>Preparing for Scaring</h4>


<p>It was a chilly afternoon in October. The Trash buddies had been waiting for this day for months, and it had finally arrived. It was the spookiest and most chocolatey day of the year: Halloween. The Trash Buddies had loved Halloween ever since they were little. Creatures all around the meadow and woods would dress up in cool costumes and hand out candy to the little kids, and they'd all end the night at the picnic log. They'd share candy and baked goods while the adults told stories. There would be silly stories, scary stories, and stories in between. </p>

<p>The Trash Buddies were finally old enough to take part in the best part of Halloween. In previous years, they'd just dressed up and gone trick or treating around the woods. However, this year they would get to collect candy in the neighborhood, and they'd finally get to try telling stories of their own. </p>

They were all excited for different reasons. Rascal was fascinated by fantasy, and he loved telling others about what was happening in his fantasy novels. He was hoping that on Halloween night he could try his hand at writing a fantasy story, too. He was sure he had learned how to tell a good story from all the reading he did. He had come up with a story about fairies and a wizard. It wasn't super scary, but he knew that's the kind of story he would excel at. He really hoped everyone would enjoy it, because he put a lot of work into writing his first story.

Gizmo was charismatic, so he was mostly excited to come up with a story that made people a little afraid but also made them laugh. He had been planning his story for about a month, and Squish loved the parts he heard. Finally, a few hours later everyone would be able to hear the story he came up with about bigfoot.

Spud felt a little different about that night. He got scared pretty often, and most Halloween nights previously, the stories really frightened him. This year, he wanted to get over his fears and tell the scariest story that he could come up with. It was going to be based on a memory of him and the trash buddies as little kids, back when they went to summer camp one year in a forest nearby. 

Other creatures would be telling stories, too. Most of the adults had come up with some sort of story, long or short. Some scary and some funny. But since it was Halloween morning, most creatures were focused on something besides stories. They were all making last minute preparations to their costumes. Everyone tried to keep their costumes a secret until Halloween night so that all their friends could be surprised. 

Back in the maple tree in the woods, Peaches and Rascal were preparing for the night together. Since Rascal loved fantasy, they had decided to be a wizard and a witch for Halloween. Peaches was really crafty, so she made a lot of the pieces for their costumes. Rascal had a crocheted blue wizard hat, as well as a cape that was sewn from materials they found in the neighborhood one day. Rascal had found some pretty stones by the waterfall and glued them on a stick to make a cool wand. Peaches also crocheted herself a hat and would wear a long green dress. She added some flair to their kitchen broom and would take that as her accessory. They felt prepared for the night. 

Squish and Gizmo were also preparing that morning. Squish was so inspired by his brother's story that he was going as bigfoot. He made his costume from all sorts of materials found in the woods, and he looked pretty frightening. Gizmo was hiding in his room, putting finishing touches on his costume. He decided to be a dinosaur this year, and he had Peaches help him. He liked for his costumes to get laughs rather than scares. 

Spud and Dumpling were both going as ghosts this year. They were simple costumes made from sheets they owned. Spud had spent most of his October writing his story, and Dumpling had been helping, so costumes weren't their focus this year. They liked ghosts, though, so they were happy with their costumes. 

The rest of the morning and afternoon, creatures all around were finishing their costumes, baking goods for the party, and getting bowls of treats together for the little ones that trick or treat.

Conversations with Foxes

As it started to get dark, little creatures around the woods started to go trick-or-treating. Peaches had a bowl of candy ready for when kids stopped by. 

"Don't you miss trick-or-treating, Rascal? That was always so fun." 

"Yeah! So many good memories. And rough ones. Remember the year Spud dropped most of his candy in the pond? That was sad. But you gave him a lot of yours." Rascal smiled at Peaches. "You're just so sweet like that."

Peaches blushed back. "Well, I try my best. You excited to do the biggest trick-or-treat yet, over in the neighborhood?"

"Yeah, it should be fun. Rowan and Lucida are going to come with to show us what they normally do. They said its a little tricky since people can be out late. It should be fun, though."

"Yeah I bet it will be a blast! Lucida sure is a character, I'm sure she will make it a great time. Especially with her and Rowan."

"Yeah, they're always bickering." Rascal laughed. "I'm pretty sure they like each other but don't want to admit it." That's what most creatures in the woods thought. Both Rowan and Lucida had these grumpy exteriors but were both so funny and sweet when you got to know them. That's why everyone thought they'd be great together. They never had been, though. 

"Maybe one day they'll realize, then they can be happy in love like us." Peaches smiled at Rascal and fixed his crooked wizard hat. They heard a knock at the door, and it was their first trick-or-treaters. Halloween was here.

Gizmo and Squish walked over to grab Rascal, then they all went to go see Spud and Dumpling. They had a few hours until it'd be dark enough to go to the neighborhood, but they planned to meet the foxes on the bridge to talk about the night. 

Rowan arrived first. He was dressed as a vampire, but it was a very low-key costume. He still enjoyed Halloween, but being the older fox that he was, dressing up wasn't as important to him. What Rowan looked forward to most this year was teaching the Trash Buddies how to succeed in neighborhood trick-or-treating. When Lucida arrived, dressed as a mermaid, Rowan told them what they needed to know.

"You have to get the timing just right. The kids trick-or-treat right around dusk, and they finish when most of the stars are visible in the sky. We'll be able to collect dropped candy from the roads anytime, but what we want is candy in the bowls. And the people put those away just after the kids stop coming by, so we have to be quick and can't be seen." Rowan explained, and the Trash Buddies started to get nervous. They knew the timing would be hard.

Lucida explained that hiding in bushes would be useful. "We want to try to cross the road when the kids are still out, then we want to hide in the bushes. As soon as we see an opening, we'll grab whatever candy we can from the road and bowls on the porches, then hide in another bush until we can move on down the road." 

The foxes tried to make sure the Trash Buddies knew what they'd be getting into, but also encouraged them. Lucida and Rowan knew that the Buddies had a lot of capability, and they were proud to pass this duty on. 

As the sun started to go down, Squish and Dumpling went back to their homes to finish passing out candy, and the rest of the group headed down to the fir and pine trees, ready to seize the night.

Trick-or-Treat

When they approached the highway, they could hear children yelling in the distance. It seemed like most of the kids had already gone home, and the last few were running around to get their last bits of candy. The Trash Buddies and their fox friends stepped right past the tree line and waited for the perfect moment to cross. They looked every way and then dashed across the road to hide in the closest bush. 

The house next-door had the lights off, and as the last kid nearby ran off, the Trash Buddies took their chance to get candy. They all ran to the front of the house. While Spud and the foxes collected candy that had been dropped around, Gizmo and Rascal headed up to the porch. There was a big orange bowl, and a bunch of candy was left inside. They grabbed their bags and filled them, making sure to leave a few pieces of candy in the bowl in case anymore children came by. 

They spent a while continuing down the road. They would hide in bushes and take turns going to the porches. Not every house had bowls of candy, those were just houses where the people didn't want to or couldn't interact with the kids. So they felt pretty safe going on those porches, as long as no children were in sight. 

They continued down the road until they came to a yellow house. They went around back and spotted their pal, Rebel. Rebel knew the plan for the night and had been waiting for his friends.

"Hey guys! How is trick-or-treating going?"

"Its great!" Spud said excitedly. "You enjoying Halloween?"

"Yeah, my moms are inside having lots of fun. One is dressed like a frog and another is a chicken! Do you like my special outfit?" Rebel was wearing a skeleton shirt and a cute bandana around his neck. Everyone said they loved his costume, and Rebel remarked about each of their outfits. 

The foxes had been waiting in the bush and walked up. Lucida never met Rebel before, so she made sure to introduce herself.

"Hey! I'm Lucida. It's great to meet you, I've heard so many stories." Lucida smiled at Rebel. They talked for a minute before Rebel asked if anyone wanted some treats. 

"We'd love some!" said Rascal and Gizmo in unison. Rebel went inside. It took him a minute. He had to say hi to his moms and sneak the treats, then he came back outside with a few for everyone. 

"I hope you enjoy them! I heard you guys are going to tell stories later. I wondered if you wanted to hear one from me quick? It’s not really a scary one, if that’s fine." Everyone in the group told him they’d love to hear it, so Rebel told them a little story. 

"Once upon a time there was a little puppy named Pablo. Pablo was a rambunctious boy, and he loved getting into trouble. He was a puppy, after all. He and his brother Renaldo lived on a farm. They didn't have any other family, but Pablo always dreamed that he’d find a family one day. Pablo and his brother Renaldo loved going on adventures. One day they decided to wander over to a nearby river. Renaldo asked if they could go for a swim. They enjoyed paddling sway for hours, but suddenly the current pulled them away. They kept trying to latch onto the land with their little paws, but nothing worked. When the water finally calmed down, they were miles away from their little farm. They ended up deep in a dark forest. Renaldo started to get scared, so Pablo scouted for a shelter for the night. They checked a den, but there were raccoons inside. They were scared of what other animals could be nearby. They knew which animals were mean or nice in the farm, but not out here. They finally settled on a big bush under the canopy of a tree. It was chilly, but they were safe. They tried to get some rest, but there were too many noises in the forest. Every time Pablo would close his eyes, he would hear a coyote in the distance. Each time he heard it, it would be closer than the last time. When Pablo got too scared, he closed his eyes tight until he could fall asleep.

When the dogs woke up the next day, the forest didn't seem as scary. They actually enjoyed it. They played tag, running laps around trees. They listened to birds singing, and they even made friends with some of the animals there. They decided to stay a few more days. Renaldo was starting to enjoy it there more than the farm. Pablo wasn't sure, though. He liked it here, and he liked the farm. But neither place felt truly like home. While Renaldo was playing with some squirrels, Pablo took a walk by himself through the forest. It was quiet and peaceful, then all of a sudden he heard people. He loved people. When they got closer, he could see it was two ladies holding hands. The ladies saw him hiding behind a bush, and they walked over to him to say hello. "Aw, he doesn't have any tags! Do you think he has family?" "I'm not sure, he is so sweet though!" Pablo loved the attention. The ladies were petting him and smiling, and he felt something he never felt before. He thought maybe it was love. 

Pablo got nervous. He liked the ladies, and he thought maybe he could finally have the home he always dreamed of. But what about Renaldo? Pablo howled out until Renaldo came. "What should I do?" He asked his brother. Renaldo loved Pablo, and he wanted him to be happy. "You should go for it! I'll be fine here. And I'm sure I can come find you and we can play!" The brothers said goodbye for now, and Pablo went up to the ladies. He jumped up and licked their faces, letting them know he would love to go home with them. 

Pablo went home with them, and soon it felt like his home. There were toys and treats and a bed just for him. Renaldo would come visit sometimes, they lived just across from the forest. Pablo was finally happy. He had what he always dreamed of, a family.”

When he finished, Rebel waited for reactions from the group. Lucida spoke first. “Aw, that was such a sweet story Rebel. Was that supposed to be based on you and your family?”

“Yeah! It’s mostly true, I just changed a little bit. Did you like it?” Everybody told Rebel they loved his story. Then he handed Spud a notebook. "I wrote it in here, in case you'd maybe want to share it at the party later. Only if you think others would like it." Rebel was a little nervous about sharing his story with so many creatures.

"Of course! I'll read it before mine later. I'm sure everyone will love it. Then they can all get to know more about you." Rascal offered. After that, Rebel headed back inside and the group continued on. They went to a few more houses and grabbed as much candy as they could. They had a couple close calls with children, but Rowan helped keep them safe. When the group felt satisfied with what they had collected, they headed back to the woods to join the party. 
Two Dozen Sherlocks

When the group of friends arrived back into the woods, they could hear the party almost from the tree line. When they got closer, they could see so many friends. Even creatures they barely knew were there, since everyone was invited. The Trash Buddies were getting more excited.

When they got to the log, they emptied their bags into bowls on the log. There was so much candy for them all to share. They all took a look at each other’s costumes. Mochi was a fairy, and Juniper put ornaments on her spikes to be a Christmas tree. Primrose was a princess, while Fawn was a knight. The squirrels were both dressed as little ducklings. Clove was a witch, just like Peaches. Cypress and the other couple dozen mice in his colony were all dressed like their favorite book character, Sherlock Holmes. It was funny seeing so many Sherlocks. All the creatures had a good laugh when they saw the mice come to the party one at a time, all dressed exactly the same with miniature hats and magnifying glasses. 

Most of the animals sat by the log and shared candy and treats. They had collected tons of different types of candy to try when they went to the neighborhood, and some of the creatures had made cookies and brownies to share as well. Gizmo and Squish grabbed a bunch of sticks that they'd collected previously, and they made a little fire to enjoy while they told stories. It got nice and toasty, and the animals gathered around. When everyone was ready, they got ready to begin story time.

The sky was dark and the stars were shining bright. Clove started the stories off. Though she wasn’t an adult yet, she loved romance and fairytale stories and wanted to tell hers. Her story was about a princess trapped in a castle. She long awaited her prince to get her out, but one day when the door opened, it wasn't a prince at all, but a gnome. The princess was confused. She was thankful to her savior, and they became friends. And a few days later, they fell in love. When the princess kissed the gnome, he turned into a prince. And they lived happily ever after. 

Fawn was next. She told a story based on her life. It was about two deer who were bullied for loving each other, so they ran off together to live where they were accepted. It wasn't scary, but it was sad and heartwarming. Everyone in the woods loved Fawn and Primrose, and they thanked Fawn for sharing her story. 

Cypress told a story about a mouse and a giant. Ponchy and Sinnamon attempted to tell a story together about zombie chipmunks, but they got into a laughing fit near the beginning and they gave up. 

Everyone was having tons of fun, eating candy and roasting snacks over the fire. Finally, it was time for the Trash Buddies’ stories to begin. 

Before his story, Rascal retold the story that Rebel had told them. Everyone loved it. A lot of the creatures had met Rebel at least once, and whoever hadn't now really wanted to. It was a sweet, heartwarming story. 

Telling a story that wasn't his own helped Rascal shake off his nerves. Now, it was time to start his own story.

The Dark Grove of Gromnere

"In the land of Gromnere, there was a forest called the Dark Grove. Everybody had heard the stories of that forest, and how it was haunted by dark fairies. The tales told that long ago, fairies had moved into the Grove and put dark magical spells all around which would trap anyone who came near. There are stories of people going in and never returning, but that was so long ago. About one hundred years back, the council of Gromnere had put chains around the forest to mark the borders that were not to be crossed. And nobody had since. 

However, someone now wanted to. There was a young wizard, Bastian, who decided one day that he was going to prove that the tales of the Dark Grove were all made up. He lived nearby the forest, and when he was younger he always wanted to explore there but his mother never let him. Now that he was sixteen and his wizard training had started, he decided that he was ready to go. 

Bastian didn't tell anybody his plans, but spent weeks preparing for his adventure. He filled a bag with spell books, potions, snacks, and hiking supplies. He felt prepared. When the day finally came, he walked to the edge of the forest. Once it was dusk, he lifted the chain around the trees and stepped into the forest. 

Immediately once his feet were in the forest, it became pitch black. He knew the sun had just fell moments ago, so this was impossible. Bastian started to get an eerie feeling that maybe he made a bad decision. He turned around, thinking maybe he would try during daytime tomorrow instead. But when he put his hand down the grab the chain, it was gone. He looked around, and he finally noticed that his surroundings had changed. He was no longer at the forest line with his house visible in the distance. He was in the middle of the Dark Grove, as if some sort of magical presence had transported him there right as the soles of his feet hit the ground. 

Bastian admitted it. He was scared. More than scared, really. He was shaking in his wizard boots completely frightened. All of a sudden he realized that sixteen is too young to make such rash decisions, and he was not quite as grown up as he thought. 

Bastian couldn't just stand there. He knew nothing else to do but walk. Whether he find his way home or end up in more danger, he had to start moving. He looked at the ground and saw four paths leading to the very spot he was standing. Each path had a wooden sign in front of it. One sign had frogs, another fish, another mushrooms, and another gnomes. He figured gnomes meant scary magic, and he was afraid of water so he didn't pick fish. He didn't know if he should pick frogs or mushrooms, so he took a coin from his bag and flipped it. Mushrooms it was. 

Bastian started walking down the dirt path, and every few steps he would see a few mushrooms. He thought to himself, this must be good news, the sign was literal and its just a path of mushrooms. As he kept walking, he looked only ahead and at the ground. Had he looked behind him, he would have realized that he wasn't alone on this path.  

Bastian continued walking, but the path seemed to go on forever. How was it still so dark? He figured the sun should be out by now. As he continued, he saw some trees arching over the path a few steps away. He assumed this must be the only way, so he crouches down and walks beneath them. When he comes out the other side, the darkness is gone. Suddenly, the forest is bright and white. The mushrooms are gone, and now all along the forest he can see what the magic had been masking the whole time. Fairies. Each mushroom he had seen along the way, hundreds, had been a fairy masking themselves with dark magic. Bastian was alone, deeper in the forest than ever, surrounded by fairies. 

He screamed.

The fairies started walking closer to him, and without a word, they grabbed him and led him to a castle down the path. They went through so many sets of locked doors and gates that Bastian lost count. He knew he would never find his way out of there. When he arrived at the end of the hallway and went into one last room, he saw who he had been brought to see. A king, a queen, and princess. They were all fairies. The fairies he had seen before all looked different, but these ones you could tell were family. Porcelain white skin, pitch black wings and clothes, and blood red crowns. He wondered if they were actually covered in blood. The fairies brought him to stand before the king, and they let go. 

"Why have you entered our Grove?" The King asked sternly. "Nobody is to enter our territory.”

Bastian froze. He didn't know what to say. But apparently, he didn't need to. The King could read his thoughts.

"So you thought you'd be brave and prove to the world we don't exist? Are you not a wizard? How could you be so foolish?" The king belted out in a deep laughter. Bastian knew he was a fool. He was a wizard. He knew magic existed. He wasn't sure why he was so skeptical that fairies could exist, as well. 

"When people enter our Grove, we do not give second chances. You have two choices. You may stay here as a servant, sleeping in the dungeon and only coming out to work in the castle of the fields. Or you may marry our daughter and have all the riches of the world. The freedom to walk around the castle and Grove as you please. It is your choice, and you must decide by next nightfall." Bastian saw the princess smiling at him, then the guard fairies took him away to wait in the dungeon until he must make his decision. 

Bastian sat on the cold floor confused. Be a servant or marry a beautiful princess. There must be some sort of trick. Or maybe he is supposed to think it is a trick and pick the bad option. He kept thinking and thinking of all the possibilities of what could happen. The princess was so beautiful with long braided white hair and black wings that could wrap around him. It sounded like a dream. But he thought it must be a trick. He took out his magical books, and everything he read said that fairies are tricksters but they must not lie when making deals. Which meant if he picked to be a servant, be must be a servant. He made his decision and awaited the guards' return. 

When he arrived back in the royal office, the king already knew his answer. He could see it in Bastian's mind. But he asked for confirmation, to make the choice official. 

"What were the terms, once more, before I make my decision?" Bastian wanted to hear the exact wording again, to make sure if there were some trick that he could catch it. Then, he spoke his answer. 

"I would like to marry the princess. I would like to live like a prince." When his word was spoken, his decision was final.

"Ahh, what a choice you have made. Dear Nimona, please go greet your betrothed." The princess walked up to Bastian. She was taller up close, a whole head taller than Bastian. She leaned down and grabbed both of Bastian's hands. His heart was pounding. She planted a kiss upon his lips. He started to get cold, then everything went white. 

Hours later, Bastian awoke. Everything he saw was still white. Too white. He looked down at his hands, and they were also white. What happened? He got up and went to the halls. Fairies were all over. They looked at him but did not stop him. After wandering for a while, he found the King. He was sitting, smiling. His princess was there, too. She looked different, though. Something was wrong. 

"What's going on? I am a prince, right? I can leave if I please?"

"Yes, you are a prince. And you may leave. You are free." The King just smiled at him. Bastian didn't understand. He walked up to his new wife, and looked into her eyes. They were brown. He thought they had been white before. He looked deeper, and he saw his reflection. He was completely white. He touched his back, and there were wings. 

"So I'm a fairy prince? You didn't say I would turn into a fairy."

"Ah, you did not ask or I would have told you." The King smiled again. "Thank you for marrying my beautiful Nimona. We are all thankful for your generous act. We have been trying to find her a husband for years."

Bastian was more confused then ever. He thought about what he had been told. He would marry the princess, have riches, and the freedom to walk through the mansion  and Grove. He decided to test this. He ran outside. He ran as far as he could. The forest was different. It looked normal, as if he were in his own world. It wasn't pitch black nor white, but brown and green like a regular forest. He kept running and found the line. The chain was there, and he tried to jump over it. He wanted out as fast as possible. It didn't work. He tried to lift the chain, but when he touched it, it burned him. He looked around frantically, and he saw his new princess wife coming towards him. She was walking elegantly. He wondered how she caught up so fast. She came up to him and smiled before picking up the chain and stepping under. She was outside the forest, back in Gromnere. As soon as she stepped under, her skin tanned and her wings disappeared. She took off her crown, blew Bastian a kiss, and ran off. 

Bastian felt flabbergasted. He tried again, but still couldn't get through. He marched back to the King to get an explanation. 

"Ah, you've not figured it out yet, huh boy?"

"I'm not just a 'boy'. I'm a prince now. What is going on?"

"Alright, alright. I thought a wizard would be smart enough to figure it out." The King paused. "When you kissed my daughter, she used her magic to take part of your soul. Everything that makes you a human, she took from you. And you took some of her magic in exchange, which is why you're now a fairy."

"So why can't I leave the grove but she can?"

"Only humans may cross over, and you gave that part of yourself up. Honestly, if you had chosen to be a prisoner you probably would have escaped. We don't really enjoy having humans around, and we have enough prisoners." The King laughed.

Bastian paused. "So I'm stuck here. Forever. But I'm a prince, right? I do get the riches? I read that you cannot tell direct lies."

"Yes of course. But you're really not special. We all share the riches, here. And most fairies in this kingdom are royal. You made the wrong decision, boy. Now live with it. Go off and live your new life."

So Bastian left. He left the palace to go explore. He didn't know where he was going, but he was determined to find a way out of the grove, if it was the last thing he would do.

And that is the end. For now at least." Rascal finished his fairytale, and he was ready to hear what everyone thought. Only Peaches had heard it so far, and she hadn't heard all of it.

"Oh sweetie," Peaches said. "That was amazing! You're such a good storyteller. I want to know what happens next!"

"Yeah, me too!" Lots of creatures chimed in.

"Man, how am I supposed to follow that?" Gizmo remarked.

"Aw thanks guys. I'll write more and tell you all another time, if you're really interested. And I'm sure yours will be great, Giz." Rascal felt relieved and calm. He was glad everyone loved his story. It took a lot of time and work to write, and he felt proud of himself. After a big smooch from Peaches, he sat down and let Gizmo take over.

Madness and Monsters

"Deep in the forest, there lived a creature called Bigfoot. Bigfoot was extraordinarily tall, and he was covered in thick brown hair from head to big toe. He fancied himself as pretty handsome, but people were always making him question that. People would come into his forest hiking, and then they'd scream when they saw him. He didn't know if people thought he was scary or just ugly. He normally tried to ask, but his English wasn't the best and the people tended to disappear pretty quickly. He wished they would stay and get to know him. 

Bigfoot didn't have any family, and his only friends were some ground squirrels who lived in the trees outside his cave. He didn't mind being alone, but he sometimes got bored. The squirrels were fun to play with. He would throw nuts and the squirrels would go wild fetching them. They'd play hide and seek sometimes, but Bigfoot was growing tired of only being the seeker. Though he appreciate his life, everyday he grew more hopeful that something would change. 

One random Saturday, things did change. From Bigfoot's cave, he heard a noise nearby. He got up and looked outside. It was a person! A little blonde headed child, in fact. Bigfoot hadn't seen many children, before. Normally only adults wandered this far into the forest. He got worried that maybe the child was lost.

Bigfoot grabbed a hat and started walking towards the little boy. He didn't want to startle him. By Bigfoot's surprise, the boy ran up and hugged him. Bigfoot was so taken aback he staggered and fell on his butt, with a loud crash. 

"Hey Bigfootina! Happy to see you, I think I got a little lost!"

Bigfoot was confused. 'Bigfootina?' 

"What? I . . ." Bigfoot stuttered. "I Bigfoot. Who Bigfootina?"

The little boy took a step back, just as confused as Bigfoot. After a moment of realization, the little boy said "Oh, sorry! I thought you were my friend Bigfootina. You look so alike, but I guess Bigfootina looks a little different. Are you nice? I'm only supposed to talk to nice people?" The boy talked quickly and confidently.

Bigfoot was even more confused now, but he was excited that for once, someone was talking to him without running away. "I friend. Are you friend?" 

"Ah, I see. You don't talk as well as Bigfootina. I am a friend if you're a friend." The boy smiled and stuck out his tiny hand. "My name is Brayden and I am 9."

"Hi Brayden. I Bigfoot." Bigfoot offered his hand to Brayden to shake. 

"Nice to meet you! So, I'm a little lost. Can you tell me where Bigfootina's cave is from here? I can find my way home from there."

"Who Bigfootina?" Bigfoot asked the little boy this again, as he still didn't know who that was or how the little boy could have possibly got someone confused with him. 

"Oh, you don't know her? She looks about the same as you, just a little shorter. And a lady. She lives in a pretty cave and is always taking me on adventures when my parents are busy. I really like her." The little boy smiled. "How have you never met her? I'm sure she can't be too far from here. I haven't been lost for too long."

Bigfoot was perplexed. He'd never seen anyone else like him, besides his parents when they left him in a cave as a child, as is normal for his species. He had weird feelings in his tummy. A lady Bigfoot? 

Bigfoot told the little boy that he had never met her before, which surprised him. Then he said he didn't know there were more creatures like him out here. Brayden felt bad. "Maybe I can introduce you? If you help me get home." Bigfoot took that deal, but he suddenly got really nervous. 

"Bigfootina pretty?" The boy shrugged and said that he thought so. Brayden wasn't sure how to tell what categorized someone of that species as pretty. Bigfoot was worried that when he saw Bigfootina, he wouldn't know how to react.  Brayden said he would help, so they started their trek. 

Brayden described where he lived, so Bigfoot tried his best to find the area. The little boy's description wasn't the most helpful, but Bigfoot hoped he could at least get close enough for Brayden to find his way. And he did. The two of them ended up on a fork in a road next to the tallest Oak in the forest. Brayden recognized this spot. He said that going right would be to his house, left would be to Bigfootina, and apparently the tiny trail they walked to get to that spot led to Bigfoot. "Darn, how did I mess up the trails? I've never done that before. Oh well, at least I met you!" Brayden seemed very thankful for meeting Bigfoot, which made him feel happier than ever before. 

By now it was very late, and Brayden needed to head home. He promised he would be back a week from now to introduce him to Bigfootina. So off went Brayden, and off went Bigfoot back to his cave, nervous and excited about next week. For now he would prepare."

Gizmo stopped there, and everyone around stared at him waiting for him to continue. 

"So . . . What happens next, bro?" Squish asked with anticipation. Gizmo thought it was funny seeing Squish dressed as Bigfoot asking what would happen next. 

"Well . . . I ran out of time to finish writing the story. And I can't think of a good ending right now."

"No!" Everyone sounded sad. "I want to know how it goes when they meet." Said Ponchy.

"I want to know if they fall in love," chimed in Clove. 

“And the story is called Madness and Monsters. Where’s the monsters, Giz?” Squish asked his brother frantically.

"Hm, well how about I take a couple weeks and finish the story at our annual Thanksgiving fest?"

Everyone said that that sounded good, even though they'd rather find out now. Though people were sad the story didn't finish, they told Gizmo that his story was funny and great so far. Gizmo was proud that he was able to make people smile.

"Alright, last story of the night! Take it away, Spud."

One Night at Summer Camp

“Years ago, four friends visited Elmwood Summer Camp. This is the story of how those four friends became three.”

Already there were oohs and ahhs in the audience. Spud smiled and continued. He was ready.

“The friends called themselves The Four Seasons. There was Florence, a kind and shy little skunk who was personally blooming lately, so he was their Spring. Beckett the possum always had a sunny demeanor, so he was their Summer. Ash the raccoon was the coolest of the group, so he was their Autumn. Lastly, though Aspen the Badger seemed cold on the outside, he was just a ‘to the point’ kind of guy. He was their Winter. The group of Four Seasons had been friends since they were babies pretty much, growing up in a forest nearby Elmwood. Their personalities were all so different, but as a group they really complemented each other. This year, they were finally big kids and were off to Summer Camp together. They all tried to pretend they were confident, but each was a little nervous to be away from home for four weeks. They all had their friends, though,  which made it a little less scary.

They all got to camp on a Friday night and found their bunk, cabin number seven. They went in and saw the room had seven beds. 

“Cool! We’ll have three more friends to hang out with!” Beckett said cheerfully. As the friends unpacked their bags, their new roommates walked in with one of the camp counselors.

“This is your bunk! Oh look, your other roommates are already here. Hi, I’m Randolph, I’ll be the bunk leader for cabins 7 and 8. Nice to meet you all! I’ll be checking in later but let me know if you need anything. Head to the sign-up table when you’re all unpacked.” Randolph started to walk away, then said “Welcome to Elmwood Summer Camp.” He smiled and took off, and then all the roommates got acquainted. There were two brother squirrels, Bash and Parin, who seemed to be very outgoing, just like Beckett and Ash. There was also a little fox named Cedar, and he seemed a little shy and nerdy like Florence. Everyone picked their bunks and got unpacked. Then together, they all walked to the other end of camp to find the sign-up table.

There were so many kids everywhere. Rabbits, possums, coyotes, squirrels. Boys and girls of all different species, all there to make friends, learn, and have fun together for a while month. The roommates of cabin seven all made it to the sign-up table, which was managed by some of the camp counselors. 

“Hi guys! I’m Daisy.” Said a sweet deer. “I’m the bunk leader for a few of the girls’ cabins, but I’ll be helping everyone around camp this summer. And right now I’m here to help you choose activities to sign up for! Here’s some sign up sheets. Let me know if you have any questions!”

The roommates got their clipboards and looked at the list of activities and the summer calendar. 

“Woah, bonfires every Friday! That will be so fun!” exclaimed Ash.

Besides some mandatory bunk meetings and recommended group learning sessions, they were free to choose how to spend their time. There were a few activities that were in groups and you would do it for a week straight, including arts and crafts, hiking, swimming in the lake, skills classes, and cooking classes. There were also activities you could sign up to do anytime,  like board game nights or fantasy role-play groups. They could read in the library, have social groups, or even free time to play in the field, playground, or the gymnasium. 

“This all sounds so awesome!” Florence was so excited by all the choices. The Four Seasons and their roommate all filled out their sign-up sheets. They made sure to do a few things together, as well as pick things they’re most interested in so they could make new friends. 

“Alright, your forms look good! Tomorrow morning, come back to this table for your finalized schedule. Now go have fun! It’s free time for the rest of the day, until our first bonfire. Dusk tonight at the fire pit. Not mandatory, but hope to see you there!” Daisy gave them all a big smile before helping the next kids in line.

The roommates all went around camp together, checking it out. Next to the sign- up and help booth is are four girls cabins, as well as the lake behind them. 

“I’m so excited to go swimming!” Beckett said really loudly. The lake was pretty big, and there were rafts laying around in it. It looked really pretty blue. There was sand around the lake, perfect for relaxing in the sun. Towards the center of camp is a big open area to run around and play, with the biggest bonfire right in the middle. They read that there would be big bonfires with camp stories and snacks every Friday, but there would also be small fires most other nights as well. East of the fire pit were the camp counselors’ cabins, with a forest behind for hiking. South were the four boy cabins, where they were staying. Being them was the playground and a field for playing. 

“Woah! It’s so close. We can just wake up and go straight to playing!” Bash was excited to play on the playground with his brother. Since they were smaller than lots of the other animals, the playground looked huge to them. 

West of the boy bunks were an art tent and a club tent. Lastly was a really big cabin.  They all went to see what was inside. There was a big cafeteria on one end, and a gymnasium with toys and games on the other end. In the middle was a big open room. There was a quiet library space in one corner, and the rest of the room was filled with couches and tables to play games or just hangout with friends. The boys were all really excited to start their adventure. 

They decided to get some food and wander a bit more, and then they hung out in the cabin getting to know each other better until it was time for the bonfire.

As soon as the sun started going down, the cabin seven roommates all ran to the fire pit. Kids were already filing the stump seats around the fire. They saw seven open seats close to the fire, so they went to go sit. As soon as they started sitting down, they heard someone yell.

“Hey! Those are our seats. Get up!” It was a big fox, and he had some friends behind him. 

“I’m sorry, we were already sitting here. There’s tons of other seats in the second row still open, though.” Aspen was really direct, but nice. 

“No, those are our seats. Get up, now.” The fox sounded really mean and angry. His friends stepped up, and the Four Seasons started to worry that the fox and his friends might hurt them. They decided to just get up and find other seats, they knew they’d have just as much fun in the next row. They were a little upset that there were bullies here, though. Each of the friends thought to themselves, ‘I hope we don’t see much of them this summer.’

When the kids were all seated, the ten young adult and teenage came counselors came out, as well as the four adults that run the camp. They all introduced themselves, talked about the camp and what to expect during the summer. Then, they lit the fire. It was full of logs and twigs, and it burned really high and bright. Everyone took turns to roast snacks over the fire, then they told some scary stories. Their bunk leader, Randolph, told a legend about Elmwood Summer Camp. He said it was believed that ghosts lived there, and if you summoned them, bad things would happen. He laughed and said it wasn’t real, but said not to do it just in case. The other counselors told some stories, as well as some kids. Then they saw a fox stand up. It was the bully from earlier.

“Hey, I’m Tommy. I have a good story for you all.” He smiled slyly. He started telling a story about monsters that really didn’t make much sense. When it seemed like his story was over, out of nowhere he exclaimed “Oh ghosts of Elmwood Summer Camp, I summon you to come to our camp. I summon you to wreak havoc all around.” He started laughing and headed to his seat, then he looked right at the Four Seasons. Under his breath he said, “I summon you to torture those twerps.” Some kids laughed and some booed him.  The counselors decided that would be the end of the fire, and everyone headed back to their bunks.

When they got inside cabin seven, Cedar asked his roommates, “So what was up with that Tommy guy? He was so mean! And summoning ghosts, I don’t know if I believe but why would you do that?” Cedar sounded a bit nervous.

Ash told him not to worry, he was just a bully and didn’t deserve their attention. They decided to let it go for now  and hung out for a few before heading to sleep.

They woke up to a loud bell, alerting everyone in camp that it was time to start they day. They got ready and headed back to the sign-up area and got their finalized schedules. They had lots of activities every week, but there would be one focus each week. This week was arts and crafts, which Florence was most excited for. Next week was swimming, Beckett’s first choice activity. The week after was what Ash looked forward to most, hiking. The last week they were there would be focused on skill building, which Aspen was looking forward to. They were all excited to get started. 

Today they would go to the art table and learn about the crafts they’d make that week. Daisy was their art leader, which they were excited about. She seemed very sweet. 

They spent the rest of Saturday getting to know the other kids that would be in their art group, and Sunday was a free day for everyone. They each found a club to join and spent the day playing. 

When Monday came around, the For Seasons got ready, ate breakfast, then headed to their first art class. Today they would be weaving bracelets, which is a summer camp staple. The boys were excited, but after they began, someone interrupted. Daisy had stepped away for a minute, giving Tommy free reign to bully them.

“Hey girls haha. Why are you making bracelets, are you girls?” Tommy belly laughed at his own joke. 

“Anyone can wear bracelets, Tommy.” Florence spoke up. Though he was shy, he hated gender stereotypes and always spoke up when he heard something  that upset him.

“Haha, yeah. Anyone that’s a girl. What’s next, you gonna come to the bonfire in a dress?”

“So what if I did?” Florence was getting angry. He didn’t wear dresses himself but he believed anyone should wear what makes them comfortable. He was pretty wise for a child. 

Tommy started to speak up, but he saw Daisy approaching and walked off. Daisy asked how everything was going. The boys didn’t want to be tattletales, so they said everything was fine and continued their bracelets. 

The next day during art, something weird happened. After lunch break, they came back to finish their papier mâché projects to find them all destroyed. First they thought Tommy did it, but they engendered seeing him during lunch. They were confused and Daisy was distraught, but other kids pitched in and helped fix the projects. Thursday, something weird happened again. When Daisy went to get that day’s supplies out of the cabinet, all the art supplies were gone. Class was canceled so Daisy could try to figure out what happened, but she didn’t. 

Friday rolled around again. It was their last day of art class. Daisy had scrounged up some more materials and everyone made whatever they wanted. There were beaded necklaces, fantasy role-play props, weaved baskets, and lots of other creative things. 

“I really enjoyed art class, even though weird things kept happening. How about you guys?” Florence asked his friends. 

“Yeah, it was fun. I’m excited to show my brother what I made.” Said Ash.

When it got dark, they had another fun bonfire. Tommy and his friends didn’t come, so they had no worries. They ate hotdogs and gazed at the stars. The fire went late that night, until everyone was barely awake. Then they headed back to their bunks to get some rest. 

On Saturday, the friends went to the lake and met their swimming coach, a raccoon named Sammy. He told them that safety was their focus and listed off some rules. He let them play in the shallow water, but no swimming until Monday.

Sunday the Four Seasons hung out with new friends they’d made in their clubs,  and they had a bunk meeting with Randolph at night. When Randolph came over, he brought cabin eight as well. The friends all froze when they saw Tommy and his friends come over. They didn’t realize they were neighbors. While Randolph asked how ensuring was going so far and tried to instill some camp spirit, Tommy was glaring at the boys. It was uncomfortable for everyone. 

Monday ended up being worse than expected when they saw all of cabin eight was in their swimming class. 

“Oh brother. He better not ruin this for everybody.” Beckett, who was always warm and chipper, felt upset. He was so excited to swim and now this bully was in their group. They tried to make the best of it and kept their distance. The first few days went well, but Thursday was a day they’d never forget. 

While Beckett was swimming a little further out then his friends, Tommy started approaching. Beckett couldn’t get past him to reach his friends, so he started swimming further out. Suddenly, he went under. His friends saw and screamed for Sammy, who swam out to help. He went under the water and grabbed Beckett, pulling him up. Beckett got scolded for swimming so far. He tried to tell Sammy what happened but instead Sammy sent him back to his cabin. All his roommates went back with him. 

When they got back, his friends asked if he was okay and what happened. They knew that Beckett was a very strong swimmer, even in deep water. They figured something went wrong.

“I’m not sure. I was swimming, then it felt like something tugged me under, hard. I didn’t see anything, though. Things just went black when I went under.” Beckett was discouraged, and his friends were worried. They wondered if there were any big fish or creatures in the pond, or if perhaps Beckett just got tangled in seaweed.

The Friday bonfire wasn’t that fun. Everyone was nervous because of yesterday, and they’d just stayed in their cabin all day playing board games together. They went to the fire for an hour before heading home. They hoped that the next week hiking would go better. Ash loved exploring the forests, so hopefully they could have a good time. 

Monday they went hiking with Randolph and some other children. It was really beautiful in the woods. They climbed rocks and trees and explored most of the day. Tuesday was amazing, too. They found a creek in the woods and played with frogs and lizards.

Wednesday, Aspen and Florence were feeling sick so they stayed home. Ash and Beckett were determined to have fun, though. The morning went well, but in the afternoon, Ash lost sight of his group and was lost for two hours. Thursday was almost as bad as the Thursday before. The Four Seasons all went to the forest with their group, but when they got towards the creek, they started hearing eerie noises. Randolph didn’t know what it could be, so they headed towards camp. When they got close, it sounded like the noises were louder. It was a mixture of what sounded like creaks and whistling. But it sounded unsettling.

“It’s probably just the wind,” Randolph said,  uncertain. “Let’s get back to camp, though.”

That night, they told their other roommates about what happened. 

“What do you think it was?” asked Parin.

“I’m not sure, but it was pretty scary.” Ash didn’t mind admitting he was scared. They all were, except maybe Aspen. He was rarely afraid of anything. 

Finally, it was Friday again. They would leave next Friday morning, so this was their last bonfire of the summer. It was going to be the biggest, too. The counselors spent the morning collecting fish from the lake, and they were all going to grill them over the fire. There were the usual hotdogs and marshmallows, but also cookies, fruit, and tons of food to share. Instead of scary stories, tonight they were telling stories of their favorite camp memories that they made this summer. 

The boys of cabin seven decided they weren’t going to let Tommy and his bully friends bother them anymore. They were determined to make this a night to remember, and it was. The friends were all sitting in the back row of the fire pit, over by the counselors’ cabins. They were all gnawing on fish and stores, laughing at stories being told. There was a kid who said he made tons of friends in his role-play group. Another said she was really scared to come to camp, but felt really welcomed by her art class. The boys smiled, because they took that class with her. Some kid said they got hurt on the playground, but met their new best friend there when they helped him up. The stories were happy, funny, and heartwarming. The Four Seasons and their roommates all told stories, too, about how things kept going wrong but they still had great fun. 

It was turning out to be a great night. There was a bright full moon, so as Randolph extinguished the last bonfire of the summer, it was still bright in the camp. 

As everyone got up to head to their bunks, there was a big crashing noise in the fire pit. Everyone jumped and turned to see what happened. There was nothing there, just logs that were almost extinguished. With sighs from everyone, they started to head back to the cabins. As they got back, Tommy and his friends were standing outside cabin seven.

“Hey! I know you guys did it. You’re gonna wish your mommies were here!”

The boys were confused. “Did what?” asked  Aspen.

“You trashed our bunk! Now I’m gonna destroy you and your friends.” He had the angriest look in his eyes.

“Tommy, we didn’t do anything. We were at the bonfire all night.”

“Well, I don’t know who else would have done it. It must have been you!”

Tommy was shouting at Aspen, then in the blink the eye, the Four Seasons saw a ghost come out from behind the cabins and yank Tommy away. In less than a second, Tommy’s voice went from yelling to silence, and he vanished completely. 

“What the. . .” started one of Tommy’s friends. Then he bolted towards the counselors’ cabins with his roommates following behind.

The Four Seasons stood there, flabbergasted at what they saw. Or what they thought they saw. They weren’t sure if it was real. Moments later, they knew for sure it was real.

Three ghosts came out. They weren’t sure how to describe what they saw. The ghosts were barely there, more like visions than reality. They didn’t look like white sheets, like the kids would dress up in for Halloween. They didn’t have real shapes, they were more like flowing beings, floating right before the boys’ heads. 

“Oh God, Tommy summoned them! It wasn’t just nonsense!” Ash was scared. He never would have thought ghosts were real. He started to think, ‘were the ghosts what kept making things go wrong all summer?’

The ghosts said nothing, they just floated there. Randolph started running towards them; Tommy’s friends had alerted him about what happened. Randolph saw the ghosts and screamed. 

The ghosts started going wild, flowing all over camp, so fast you could barely see what was happening. Other kids and counselors saw, and they were all screaming and running to their cabins. One by one, the boys could see a child scream, and then a second later the child would be taken by a ghost, vanishing completely. One, two, three, four. Plus Tommy, five children had been taken. The boys didn’t know what else to do. They opened the door to the cabin and started running in. Bash, Parin, and Cedar. Then Ash, Beckett, Florence. Randolph ran in too, with Aspen behind him. They slammed the door shut, sighed in relief, and turned around. Aspen wasn’t there. 

The boys ran to the window and peeked outside. They saw a ghost floating there, holding Aspen. Then, they were both gone. 

The fire pit sparked brightly, and like nothing had happened, the ghosts were gone. Camp was completely silent. As minutes passed and it felt safe, all around the camp the animals headed outside towards the center of camp.

There was mumbling in every direction.

The kids were scared and confused. The counselors were skeptical, wondering if that really happened. It was too hard to believe. 

Bells alarmed loud, signaling everyone who wasn't outside to come out at once. The door to cabin seven opened, and they all stepped out and walked slowly to the fire pit. They were guarded, looking at their surroundings as they walked. They were looking out for ghosts in the sky, looking towards the woods and lake, hoping Aspen would pop out, yelling 'surprise.' They saw nothing, though. 

When everybody was at the fire pit, the adults took attendance. 8 children and two counselors were gone. 10 people were taken in a span of minutes. 

The Four Seasons were bawling. 

"We can't be the Three Seasons. That won't work!" Beckett was completely distraught. They were all trying to hold back tears, but it wasn't working. They were angry, afraid, and devastated. Their best friend was just gone without a trace, taken by a being who wasn't even alive. 

What was supposed to be the best summer of the Four Seasons' lives turned out to be their last. The very next day, everybody was sent home, and the camp closed for good. They brought in the best investigative squad around, but there was no hope. Those ten animals were gone, and they were never coming back. Years later, the remaining Seasons were still friends, and their grieving eased. They never once shared another scary story, though. Now they knew that when you tell a scary story, it just might come true."

Spooky and Sweet

There was silence for a minute, then everyone heard Ponchy. 

“Woah. That was intense, Spud!”

“It was scary!” Clove said, a little nervous. “The end said not to tell scary stories because it could come true. Now what if the stories tonight come true?” She sounded frantic.

Rowan laughed. “Don’t worry, Clove. It’s okay. It was just a story. Those things aren’t real. And if anything scary ever happened, you know we would always keep you safe.” He smiled and gave her a big hug. He had always been a mentor to her since they were neighbors. 

“Didn’t you say this was based on a true story?” asked Sinnamon.

“Well, based on. The ghost stuff didn’t happen. But Rascal, Gizmo, and I did go to summer camp for a few years when we were little, and there was a bully there. Remember that, Squish?” asked Spud.

Squish had been there that year in cabin nine. He was so furious when a child was bullying his brother and friends. He made sure to keep a close eye on them and helped keep the bully away so they could have fun. 

“Also,” started Primrose, “there were Four Seasons. But there’s only three of you. Was Aspen based on anybody?”

“Well, not really. There was a fourth member of our group back then, though. Tycoon. Back when he was my best friend. I didn’t really base the character off of him, though.”

The animals asked Spud more questions and praised his story. It was long but really engaging. Everybody stopped eating their snacks while he was talking because they were listening so intensely.

The moon was high in the sky, and the sounds around the forest were starting to dwindle. All the creatures in the forest said goodnight and headed home to get out of their costumes and end their Halloween nights. 

Back at Gizmo’s, Squish was pleading with his brother to finish his story.

“I will soon! Thanksgiving.”

Over at Spud’s, Dumpling was praising him for his story. Dumpling knew how hard that must have been to tell, since Spud wasn’t the best in large crowds. Dumpling made sure to let his friend know he was proud of him. Then their was a knock on the door. 

“It better not be a ghost, Spud, or I take back everything I said.” Dumpling laughed and opened the door to find Mochi standing there with Juniper.

“Hey Spud! I didn’t really see you at the end of the night, so I just wanted to come tell you how much I loved your story.”

Spud blushed, and Juniper and Dumpling giggled. “Thanks Mochi, that means a lot.”

“No problem. I hope to hear more stories from you someday. If you ever write anything else, let me know?”

“Of course.” He stated. “You’ll be the first one I tell.” They said goodnight, then Spud plopped on the couch.

“You really need to tell Mochi how you feel about her.”

“I know, Dumpling. I will soon. I’m not ready yet, but I think I’m getting there.”

Back in the maple tree, Peaches and Rascal were talking in bed. 

“I absolutely loved your story, sweetie. Do you have any ideas yet for how you’ll finish it?”

“Yeah, I have a few. I’m glad everybody liked it so much. I really want to know how Gizmo’s ends, too.” Said Rascal.

“Yeah,” said Peaches. “I definitely want to know what happens next.” Peaches paused, then asked, “I know Spud said it wasn’t, but do you think the Aspen character was actually based on Tycoon?”

“Actually, I was kind of thinking that Tycoon inspired both Aspen and Tommy’s characters. I think he is still pretty hurt and confused about losing Tycoon’s friendship.”

“Aw, that makes sense. That’s sad, though. He wrote that they got taken, but in reality Tycoon just stopped being his friend. Started being mean like that Tommy character. That’s all really sad.” Peaches felt bad for Spud. She used to know Tycoon well since he always hung out with the Trash Buddies when they were young. He really was a great guy back then.

“Yeah. Hopefully writing that story helps Spud heal a bit.”

Rascal and Peaches talked about the costumes they saw that night and about their favorite snacks and candies. Then, holding hands, they drifted off to sleep.

All around the forest and Meadow, the animals ate their last pieces of candy, got out of their costumes, and headed to bed. They all had an amazing Halloween and couldn’t wait for the next one. Such a spooky and sweet day. The moon was high in the sky, then the night turned to Morning. Halloween was over, and November was here. Time for a new adventure to begin.
